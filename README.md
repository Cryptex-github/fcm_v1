# fcm_v1

`fcm_v1` is a simple Rust Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) server library, compatible with the HTTP v1 API.

## Goals

The main goals for this library are simplicity and completeness. It should be simple enough that anyone should be able to use it without squinting at the docs for too long, yet complete enough to support the full API.

## Contributing

All forms of contribution (pull requests, issues, etc.) are gladly welcomed!
